                    HL2:C (HL2:CORE) is an extension on the idea that was Revolution, setting most of the scene in the Half Life 2 Universe. The aim is to level up, gain
					a substantial inventory and meet new people who can aid in rising to power. Either as the oppressive combine or the human resistance who fights them, once
					you have chosen your faction you are tied to said faction until your character permanently dies. (Which is restricted until Level 15 when PVP is initially enabled)
